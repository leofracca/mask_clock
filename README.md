# Mask Clock

An open source Android application for counting how many hours I wore my mask and when I need to change the filter.

[In particular I have a mask with a refill that can be used for 150 hours. So the application warns when the refill reaches that time of usage.]


### Usage

Mask Clock can be used in two ways:

1. The automatic way
   
   - First you can turn on the switch when you start using the mask
   
   - Then, when you stop using the mask you can turn off the switch and Mask Clock automatically calculates the elapsed time

2. The manual way
   
   - If you forget to turn on the switch when you start using the mask, you can manually insert the elapsed time
 
 
### Supported languages

- English
- Italiano

### About

This app was made during my free time.
I made it because when I bought my new face mask I didn't know how to count the elapsed hours with the same filter and keeping track of that.
